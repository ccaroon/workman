<h3>WHAT THIS PLUGIN DOES:</h3>
<p>
Allows the user to create a DHTML pop-up calendar and an associated
text-box that displays the selected date using 1 Rails function from within
a .rhtml file.
</p>
<h3>INSPIRATION:</h3>
<p>
Like all the other good calendar plugins, <a
href="../classes/Calendariffic.html">Calendariffic</a> relies on the
heavy-lifting performed by the Dynarch DHTML calendar (<a
href="http://www.Dynarch.com/projects/calendar">www.Dynarch.com/projects/calendar</a>/).
</p>
<h3>LICENSE:</h3>
<p>
As <a href="../classes/Calendariffic.html">Calendariffic</a> is simply a
rails extension of the Dynarch calendar, it is released under the same
license as that of the Dynarch calendar (i.e. the GNU General Lesser Public
License, <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html</a>).
</p>
<h3>BACKGROUND:</h3>
<p>
The Rails community needs another Ajax Calendar plugin like I need another
hole in my head. Fortunately for all of us, my Colt .45 single-action
Peacemaker just arrived from Ebay, complete with bullets. Okay okay, there
were a handful of questionable reasons for building this plugin.
</p>
<ol>
<li>To see if I could do it.

</li>
<li>I tried the Datetime Toolbocks plugin, which is beautiful and slick and
does everything but perform surgery and it worked like a champ&#8212;unless
I wanted to modify its look and feel, in which case I needed a PhD in
Ajaxology, which I don&#8216;t have.

</li>
<li>I tried another Calendar plugin which (in theory) possessed a configurable
look and feel, but the documentation was so lacking that I (again) had to
plumb the depths of someone else&#8216;s ruby, rails and javascript and,
well, I&#8216;m just a little too ADHD for that.

</li>
</ol>
<h3>PLEDGE:</h3>
<p>
So Here&#8216;s my Plugin Pledge.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../classes/Calendariffic.html">Calendariffic</a> won&#8216;t do as
much as Datetime Toolbocks (e.g. you can&#8216;t type in
&#8216;tomorrow&#8217; and have it guess the correct date), however it will
do the basics just fine (i.e. pick a date from a calendar) and it&#8216;ll
still be easier to alter w/ respect to look and feel.

</li>
<li>The documentation won&#8216;t [completely] suck.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>HOW TO INSTALL THE PLUGIN:</h3>
<ol>
<li>YOU MUST HAVE A FUNCTIONAL COPY OF RAILS INSTALLED ON YOUR SYSTEM

</li>
<li>YOU MUST HAVE A FUNCTIONAL RAILS PROJECT INSTALLED ON YOUR SYSTEM
(let&#8216;s say the project is called <b>myrailsapplication</b> and is
located in the linux directory <b>/myrailsapplication/</b>.

</li>
<li>Navigate to the <b>/myrailsapplication/</b> directory and type
<b>script</b>/<b>plugin</b> <b>install</b>
<b>http</b>://<b>opensvn</b>.<b>csie</b>.<b>org</b>/<b>calendariffic</b>/<b>calendariffic</b>/

</li>
<li>Press the <b>enter</b> <b>key</b> and wait for all files to be downloaded
into your rails application (files will be located in
<b>/myrailsapplication/vendor/plugins/calendariffic/</b>)

</li>
<li>You&#8216;re done.

</li>
</ol>
<h3>HOW TO USE THE PLUGIN:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Identify the .rhtml file that will display the <a
href="../classes/Calendariffic.html">Calendariffic</a> calendar.
Let&#8216;s say this file is called <b>myrailsview</b>.<b>rhtml</b>.

</li>
<li>You then need to include links to 3 Dynarch calendar javascript files which
the plugin has installed in your <b>PUBLIC/javascripts/calendariffic
directory</b>. These 3 files are called <b>&#8216;calendar.js&#8217;,
&#8216;calendar-setup.js&#8217;,</b> and
<b>&#8216;calendar-en.js&#8216;</b>. The easiest way to do this is to use
the rails function <b>javascript_include_tag</b>.

<pre>
 e.g. your myrailsview.rhtml file might have this in the &lt;head&gt; section:
 &lt;%= javascript_include_tag 'calendariffic/calendar.js', 'calendariffic/calendar-setup.js', 'calendariffic/lang/calendar-en.js' %&gt;

 Some things to note:
 The Calendariffic file, calendar-setup.js, is a slightly modified version of Dynarch's calendar-setup.js file.
 Specifically, it has 1 more function (called set_cal()) that is used to facilitate calendar creation.
 So don't try replacing Calendariffic's calendar-setup.js file with the equivalently-named Dynarch file.

 The calendar-en.js file is located in a subdirectory named 'lang'.
 The calendar-en.js file sets the language associated with the calendar to ENGLISH.
 There are MANY different language-specific javascript files located in the lang directory, so you can choose whichever is suitable for you.

 You MUST include the relative path to each of the 3 javascript files in your javascript_include_tag function
     (i.e. don't just write
         javascript_include_tag 'calendar.js'
     instead, write
         javascript_include_tag 'calendariffic/calendar.js'
</pre>
</li>
<li>To specify the look-and-feel of your calendar pop-up, you now need to
include a link to your favorite Dynarch calendar css file.

<pre>
    There are 10 different looks-and-feels to the standard Dynarch pop-up calendar and they are located within the rails directory public/stylesheets/calendariffic

    The standard method to reference 1 of these .css files in your .rhtml file is to add something like this to your &lt;head&gt; tag:
    &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag 'calendariffic/calendar-win2k-cold-1.css' %&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Here&#8216;s where you add the DHTML calendar. Add this (or something
similar) to the &lt;body&gt; portion of your .rhtml file at the point where
you want your pop-up calendar to appear:

<pre>
    for example
        &lt;%= calendariffic_input(false, 'start_date', 'calendariffic/date.png', 'start_cal', '%m/%d/%y', nil, {:class =&gt; 'myfavoriteclass', :readonly =&gt; 'true'}, {:class =&gt; 'borderless'}) %&gt;
        will yield the following HTML
            &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;start_date&quot; id=&quot;start_date&quot;, value=&quot;&quot; readonly=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;myfavoriteclass&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;calendariffic/date.png&quot; name=&quot;start_cal&quot; id=&quot;start_cal&quot; class=&quot;borderless&quot; /&gt;&lt;script language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;set_cal('start_date', 'start_cal', '%m/%d/%y');&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Details of the syntax for the calendariffic_input function are given in the
rdoc. <b>Note that you MUST supply a value for text_name and a different
value for image_name for the pop-up calendar to work</b>
</p>
</li>
<li>Once you&#8216;ve added your calendariffic_input function to your .rhtml
file, you&#8216;re done.

<pre>
     You now have a calendar icon that can be clicked on to pop-up a calendar widget.
     Once you select a date from the calendar widget, it will be displayed in your custom build text-box.
</pre>
